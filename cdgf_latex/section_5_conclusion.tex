\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, we propose an infused graph framework for recommendation (CDGF). This framework offers a scalable and efficient solution suitable for large-scale recommendation systems. It supports various domain overlapping scenarios, including both partial and full overlapping data conditions on either common users or items. Additionally, it can handle multiple domains with different distributions and structures and can be easily extended to incorporate more domains.

We evaluated the effectiveness of the model on real-world datasets and demonstrated that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy, particularly effective in handling sparse data and cold-start scenarios, while using only implicit user-item interactions. Importantly, in an era where data privacy is a growing concern, our model achieves high-quality recommendations without relying on personally identifiable information (PII) or requiring complex data engineering efforts.

Future work will focus on extending the model to handle more complex scenarios, such as enhancing its inference ability to make transductive predictions and managing dynamic data changes within the graph architecture. These improvements will further enhance the model's accessibility and ultimately aid in the adoption of real-world recommender systems.
