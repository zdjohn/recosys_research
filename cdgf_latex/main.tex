\abstract{
    Recommender systems has a very wide real world application in our everyday life. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted in recommendation systems due to their ability to capture user-item relationships in graph structures. However, data sparsity and cold start problems persist, especially when businesses expand into new sectors. GNN based recommender systems are often influenced by nodes bias, leading to over-fitting and over-smoothing issues as well as facing performance issues due to computational intensive algorithms.

    This paper proposes a novel framework that enhances target domain recommender system performance by adapting source domains user-item interactions via an augmented subgraph. (CDGF) We introduce a simple yet effective method to improve subgraph density, ultimately boosting performance while reducing graph structure complexity. Experiments conducted on Amazon review datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms several well established methods across multiple baseline metrics under the data sparsity setting as well as pure cold start recommendation tasks.
